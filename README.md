# KiotlogSN for Arduino

This library implements KiotlogSN Payload form for Arduino based IoT devices.

KiotlogSN Payload format is used to transimit secure, authenticated, bandwidth-restricted data over Cellular/IoT netowrks to a [Kiotlog](https://github.com/kiotlog/kiotlog)-based IoT platform.

## Library Requirements

* [arduino_msgpack](https://github.com/HEADS-project/arduino_msgpack)

KiotlogSN Payload for Arduino uses parts of Arduino Libs' [Crypto](http://rweather.github.io/arduinolibs/crypto.html) library.
